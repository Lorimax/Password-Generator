# Password-Generator

As part of my ongoing quest to learn Python I decided to take on a first small project.
This is a simple password generator. It has everything you would expect: a graphic user interface, options for upper case, lower case and special characters and numbers as well as variable password length. It even has the option to produce more readable passwords which alternate vowels and consonants.
Since the program includes a lot of "firsts" for me (first gui in python, first time using oop in python, ...) my focus was more on learning new stuff and getting everything to work than on, for example, creating a especially beautiful gui, and it shows.
Please feel free to try everything out or to leave comments and critique.
